# Flappy Flatty Bird

A simple web equivelant of the popular Flappy Bird game.

## Description

The project was a learning exercise on understanding javascript, through the guidance of a YouTube tutorial. That was further expanded and customised.

## How To Play
* The bird is controlled by using the space bar. The user needs to continously press it in order to give the bird elevated otherwise it will start to decend.
* The aim of the game is to maneuver the bird through the gaps in the wall. 
* For every wall you sucessfully pass through, you will be awarded a point.
* For every wall you pass through, the speed will increase giving you less time to maneuver.
